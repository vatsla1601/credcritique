        Talking about myself I really love to code. </p>
     <p>  The problem is, I'm not experienced</p>

        <section>
            <div class="content">

                <h2>cred landing page</h2>
            </div>
        </section>

    <img src="images/main/main1.png" /> <span font-size:1px>#1</span>
    <p>The animation in the landing page appears slowly & sometimes does not appear at all. The entire page
        goes with minimal, basic & a bold theme. This animation makes the page conjusted & loading takes more time.
        A possible solution to it could be using the arrow icon used in the slider of blog page, pointing downwards.
    </p>
    <img src="images/main/main2.png" /><span font-size:1px>#2</span>
    <p>
        The brand icons can be made clickable & can show the rewards those companies have offered to the clients. 
        Thus attracting more people.
    </p>
    <img src="images/main/main3.png" /><span font-size:1px>#3</span>
    <p>
        The text appears for a very short time, making the readibility poor. 
        This section does not meet the reading requirement & is just scrolled down by many customers. 
        No user wants to put effort in reading the content. 
        A possible solution to it, is increasing the time for content appearance or
        making the page completely static.

    <!-- <h3>cred blog page</h3> -->

    <section>
        <div class="content1">
            <h2>cred blog page</h2>
            <h2>cred blog page</h2>
        </div>
    </section>

    <img src="images/blog/blog1.png" /><span>#1</span>
    <p>The reader is unaware that the header is a slider.
        So the arrow in the slider/carousal should be visible for a few seconds. </p>
    <img src="images/blog/blog2.png" /><span>#2</span>
    <p>Only "latest stories" requires a heading at the top because this page is the landing page of the 
        blog section. However "credit cards" does not require any heading because there is already a named 
        button for it (at the top) & the rest pages in blogs section as well.
    </p>
    <img src="images/blog/blog3.png" /><span>#3</span>
    <p>The background of the heading is the first alphabet of it. It makes sense because 
        here we want to emphasize on the heading. However when the customer clicks on it then in the next page
    the content is more important than the heading that has already been read 
    so alphabet indexing should not be there. </p>
    <img src="images/blog/blog4.png" /><span>#4</span>
    <img src="images/blog/blog5.png" /><span></span>
    <p>These 3 pages do not have an introductory statement to it though they are equally important as the 
        remaining pages. 
    </p>
    <img src="images/blog/blog6.png" /><span>#5</span>
    <p>Under these 2 topics the images are exactly the same. There is nothing wrong in doing this however it can be 
        considered as an act of laziness. A possible solution to it is if you could add the bank name on the wallet 
        or card to distinguish the images.
    </p>
    <img src="images/blog/blog6a.png" /><span>#6</span>
    <p>The body of the page is left aligned while the footer & header of the page is centre aligned. So it will be 
        better if the design is similar too. "load more" at the botton should not be in a box.
        It should only be a clickable link with the same font because the ending of the page looks abrupt.
    </p>
    <img src="images/blog/blog7.png" /><span>#7</span>
    <p>If a page has images with real world theme, suddenly a clip-art image in between disrputs the flow
        of the page. This has been repeated twice in the blog section.

        </div>
    </section>

    <img src="images/hiring/hiring1.png" /><span>#1</span>
    <p>The blog page has the logo name as "the upper deck" but "we're hiring" page has the original logo name. 
        Hiring page is one of the most important pages of a website so a suggestion from my side is if 
        the logo name for "we're hiring" page could be "the lower deck".
    </p>
    <img src="images/hiring/hiring2.png" /><span>#2</span>
    <p>While going through the hiring section I felt that in "by type" an internship section should be added.
        It gives clarity to the people who are applying in the company. On behalf of million of students it would great if 
        there could be a seperate internship section in the hiring page.

<h2 style="color:#555;">?</h2>
<!-- <h2>Why Cred</h2> -->
<p>Why Cred? Every develepor has an individuality & uniqueness.</p>
<p>Seeing the website of Cred teaches me <span style="color:#555">minimalism</span> in designs along with an 
    <span style="color:#555">element of surprise</span>.</p>
<p>In todays world where everyone is running behind learning 'n' number of technologies. we tend to forget 
    the main point i.e. how to make an application unique.
</p>
<p>I see a <span style="color:#555">trademark</span> of cred in it's website and I <span style="color:#555">resonate</span> with it. 
    It is a chance for me to learn & grow from the very scratch as I have no prior experience, but I am willing
    to grow & give my best. <br>
    I am sure I will get a healthy learning environment & will try my level best to add value & uniqueness 
    to the company. <br>Looking forward to your reply.
